## General
When using a postgres database as backend for a Web Application severl projects end up writing custom build REST APIs 
to consume this data and make changes. This project is intended to provide a possibility to generate a REST API for 
any PostgreSQL database. 

## Related projects
There are other projects out there that have the same aim but lack certain capabilities. For our purpose

## Background
This project was started because we were facing the problem of writing a rest api for a corporate database. 
This database was changing quite often and the existing REST API had problems keeping up with the changes. Also 
there were often bugs or missing functionality in that REST API and due to restricted budget it was difficult 
to do changes. 
With this project we wanted to be able to have an up to date API for this database and be prepared for upcoming 
changes.

## Usage
ToDo

## Documentation
There is a seperate documentation for this project available here: [Documentation](doc/documentation.md)
